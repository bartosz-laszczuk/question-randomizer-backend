# Optimize CLAUDE.md

**Automatically optimizes CLAUDE.md** by analyzing size, identifying duplication, extracting verbose content to separate docs, and creating a condensed quick-reference version.

## Your Task

Execute a **COMPLETE OPTIMIZATION** of CLAUDE.md. Do NOT present a plan - execute the optimization immediately and report results.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

### 1.1 Read Current CLAUDE.md
- Count total lines
- Identify major sections and their sizes
- Note current file structure

### 1.2 Discover Existing Documentation
Search for all documentation files:
- `/docs/**/*.md`
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `/CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.
- Project-specific documentation patterns

### 1.3 Analyze for Optimization
- **Size Analysis:** Measure section sizes relative to total
- **Duplication Detection:** Compare content with existing docs
- **Content Assessment:** Identify overly detailed sections
- **Link Opportunities:** Find sections that should link to detailed docs

---

## Phase 2: Execute Optimization (Immediately)

### 2.1 Extract Verbose Sections

**ALWAYS extract these if present (>50 lines):**
- Code templates and examples → `/docs/CODE-TEMPLATES.md`
- Step-by-step setup guides → `/docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- Configuration details → `/docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- Testing strategies → `/docs/TESTING.md`
- Deployment procedures → `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- API-specific guides → `/docs/<TOPIC>-GUIDE.md`

**Extraction Criteria:**
- Section > 80 lines → MUST extract
- Section > 50 lines → Should extract if detailed/tutorial content
- Section > 30 lines → Consider extracting if mostly examples/config

### 2.2 Create Documentation Files

For each extracted section:
1. **Create new doc file** with comprehensive content
2. **Replace in CLAUDE.md** with:
   - 2-3 sentence summary
   - Key bullet points (3-5 items max)
   - Link to detailed documentation
   - Example (if critical, <10 lines max)

**Template for replacement:**
```markdown
## [Section Name]

[2-3 sentence summary of what this section covers]

**Quick Reference:**
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Key point 3

**📖 See [DETAILED-GUIDE.md](./docs/DETAILED-GUIDE.md) for complete [topic] documentation.**
```

### 2.3 Condense Remaining Content

**Reduce these sections aggressively:**
- Project structure: Keep high-level only, remove file-by-file listings
- Implementation phases: Keep checklist format, remove detailed descriptions
- Commands reference: Keep 5-10 most common commands only
- Technology stack: List names only, remove version justifications

---

## Phase 3: Final Optimizations

### 3.1 Add Documentation Index
Create a documentation index at the top:
```markdown
## 📚 Documentation Index

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture
- **[CODE-TEMPLATES.md](./docs/CODE-TEMPLATES.md)** - Code patterns
- **[SETUP-GUIDE.md](./docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)** - Setup instructions
- **[CONFIGURATION.md](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration guide
- **[TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md)** - Testing strategy
```

### 3.2 Cross-Link Documents
Ensure all extracted docs:
- Link back to CLAUDE.md
- Link to related docs
- Use relative paths
- Are listed in the documentation index

### 3.3 Verify All Links
Check that all internal links work:
- Relative paths are correct
- Referenced files exist
- Section anchors are valid

---

## Target Line Counts

### By Project Size

**Small projects (1-3 apps):**
- Target: 150-250 lines
- Maximum: 300 lines

**Medium projects (4-10 apps):**
- Target: 250-350 lines
- Maximum: 400 lines

**Large monorepos (10+ apps):**
- Target: 300-450 lines
- Maximum: 500 lines

### If Over Target

**Be MORE aggressive:**
- Extract ALL code examples (keep 1-2 minimal examples max)
- Extract ALL configuration details (keep quick reference only)
- Extract ALL step-by-step guides
- Condense project structure to high-level overview
- Remove implementation details (link to code instead)

---

## Content Strategy

### KEEP in CLAUDE.md (Concise)
- ✅ Project overview (3-4 paragraphs)
- ✅ Quick start (< 20 lines)
- ✅ Architecture decisions summary (key points only)
- ✅ Project structure (high-level tree only)
- ✅ Most common commands (5-10 commands)
- ✅ Implementation phase checklist
- ✅ Links to detailed documentation
- ✅ Troubleshooting (top 3-5 issues only)

### EXTRACT to Separate Docs (Detailed)
- 🔄 All code templates and examples
- 🔄 Step-by-step tutorials
- 🔄 Configuration examples and details
- 🔄 Testing strategy and examples
- 🔄 Deployment procedures
- 🔄 API specifications
- 🔄 Technology comparisons
- 🔄 Best practices guides

---

## Optimization Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- Each topic has ONE authoritative location
- CLAUDE.md is the entry point/index
- Detailed docs are the source of truth
- Never duplicate content

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- CLAUDE.md shows what's available
- Links guide to deeper information
- Users choose depth based on needs

### 3. Maintainability
- Update once, reference many times
- Links > duplication
- Clear ownership of content

### 4. Scannability
- Use clear section headers
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Tables for comparisons
- Code examples minimal in CLAUDE.md

---

## Output Format

After optimization, report:

```markdown
## ✅ CLAUDE.md Optimization Complete

### Results
- **Before:** [X] lines
- **After:** [Y] lines
- **Reduction:** [Z] lines ([P]%)

### Files Created/Updated
- ✅ Created `/docs/CODE-TEMPLATES.md` ([lines] lines)
- ✅ Created `/docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md` ([lines] lines)
- ✅ Created `/docs/CONFIGURATION.md` ([lines] lines)
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` (condensed with links)

### Sections Extracted
1. [Section name] ([X] lines) → `/docs/[FILE].md`
2. [Section name] ([Y] lines) → `/docs/[FILE].md`

### Validation
- ✅ All links verified and working
- ✅ No content lost (all extracted to docs)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md is within target line count
- ✅ Documentation index created
- ✅ Cross-references working
```

---

## Important Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Execute optimization immediately (don't ask for approval)
- ✅ Be aggressive with extractions (aim for target line count)
- ✅ Create comprehensive extracted docs
- ✅ Verify all links work
- ✅ Preserve all information (just reorganize)
- ✅ Keep user's voice and terminology
- ✅ Update relative links correctly

### DON'T:
- ❌ Present a plan and wait for approval
- ❌ Do "first iteration" or "Phase 1" - do COMPLETE optimization
- ❌ Remove essential context from CLAUDE.md
- ❌ Break working links
- ❌ Lose any information during extraction
- ❌ Make CLAUDE.md just a table of contents (keep quick reference)

---

## Special Cases

### If CLAUDE.md is Already Optimized
If CLAUDE.md is already < 400 lines and well-organized:
- Report current status
- Suggest minor improvements only
- Don't force changes

### If Project Legitimately Needs Longer CLAUDE.md
Some complex projects need more context:
- Multi-language monorepos
- Complex microservices architectures
- Specialized domain knowledge required

In these cases:
- Target up to 500 lines
- Focus on organization over line count
- Ensure content is highly valuable

### If User Has Custom Documentation Structure
Respect existing documentation patterns:
- Match existing doc naming conventions
- Use established directory structure
- Maintain consistent formatting

---

## Example Transformation

**Before (Verbose):**
```markdown
## Code Templates (200 lines)

### 1. Domain Entity Template
[Full 30-line code example]

### 2. Repository Interface Template
[Full 40-line code example]

### 3. CQRS Command Template
[Full 35-line code example]

[... 150 more lines of examples ...]
```

**After (Concise):**
```markdown
## Code Patterns

All code follows established templates. See **[CODE-TEMPLATES.md](./docs/CODE-TEMPLATES.md)** for complete examples.

**Quick Reference:**
- **Domain Entities:** POCOs with XML docs, zero dependencies
- **Repository Interfaces:** Task-based async methods
- **CQRS Commands:** `IRequest<TResponse>` records
- **Command Handlers:** `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`

**📖 See [CODE-TEMPLATES.md](./docs/CODE-TEMPLATES.md) for all 12 templates.**
```

**Result:** 200 lines → 15 lines (185 lines saved)
