---

## Example 1: Categorize Uncategorized Questions

### User Request
```http
POST /api/agent/queue
{
  "task": "Categorize all uncategorized questions about programming"
}
```

### Agent Execution Flow

**Step 1:** Agent analyzes the task
- Understands it needs to categorize questions
- Decides to find uncategorized questions first

**Step 2:** Calls `get_uncategorized_questions`
```json
Request: {}
Response: {
  "count": 15,
  "questions": [
    { "id": "q-1", "questionText": "What is a closure in JavaScript?" },
    { "id": "q-2", "questionText": "Explain Python decorators" },
    { "id": "q-3", "questionText": "How does async/await work?" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Step 3:** Calls `get_categories`
```json
Request: {}
Response: {
  "categories": [
    { "id": "cat-js", "name": "JavaScript" },
    { "id": "cat-py", "name": "Python" },
    { "id": "cat-gen", "name": "General Programming" }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4:** Agent analyzes each question and assigns categories

For question "What is a closure in JavaScript?":
```json
Call: update_question_category
Request: {
  "questionId": "q-1",
  "categoryId": "cat-js"
}
Response: {
  "id": "q-1",
  "categoryId": "cat-js",
  "message": "Question category updated successfully"
}
```

**Step 5:** Repeats for all 15 questions

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "taskId": "task-123",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Successfully categorized 15 questions:\n- 8 questions → JavaScript category\n- 5 questions → Python category\n- 2 questions → General Programming category"
}
```

## Example 2: Find and Merge Duplicates

### User Request
```http
POST /api/agent/queue
{
  "task": "Find duplicate questions and delete the redundant ones, keeping the better-worded version"
}
```

### Agent Execution Flow

**Step 1:** Calls `find_duplicate_questions`
```json
Request: { "similarityThreshold": 0.8 }
Response: {
  "duplicateGroups": [
    {
      "similarity": 0.95,
      "questions": [
        { "id": "q-100", "questionText": "What is a closure?" },
        { "id": "q-200", "questionText": "Explain closures in JavaScript" }
      ],
      "suggestion": "Keep q-100, delete q-200 (more concise)"
    },
    {
      "similarity": 0.92,
      "questions": [
        { "id": "q-300", "questionText": "How does async work?" },
        { "id": "q-400", "questionText": "Explain async/await in JavaScript" }
      ],
      "suggestion": "Keep q-400, delete q-300 (more specific)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Agent reviews each group

For first group (q-100 vs q-200):
- Analyzes both questions
- Agrees with suggestion to keep q-100 (more concise)
- Calls `delete_question` for q-200

```json
Call: delete_question
Request: { "questionId": "q-200" }
Response: { "id": "q-200", "message": "Question deleted successfully" }
```

For second group (q-300 vs q-400):
- Analyzes both questions
- Agrees with suggestion to keep q-400 (more specific)
- Calls `delete_question` for q-300

```json
Call: delete_question
Request: { "questionId": "q-300" }
Response: { "id": "q-300", "message": "Question deleted successfully" }
```

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Found 2 duplicate groups, deleted 2 redundant questions:\n\nGroup 1:\n- Kept: 'What is a closure?' (q-100)\n- Deleted: 'Explain closures in JavaScript' (q-200)\n- Reason: First version is more concise\n\nGroup 2:\n- Kept: 'Explain async/await in JavaScript' (q-400)\n- Deleted: 'How does async work?' (q-300)\n- Reason: Kept version is more specific"
}
```

## Example 4: Analyze Question Difficulty

### User Request
```http
POST /api/agent/queue
{
  "task": "Analyze all Python questions and suggest difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, hard)"
}
```

### Agent Execution Flow

**Step 1:** Calls `search_questions`
```json
Request: { "searchText": "Python", "limit": 100 }
Response: {
  "count": 42,
  "questions": [
    { "id": "q-1", "questionText": "What is a variable in Python?" },
    { "id": "q-2", "questionText": "Explain Python decorators" },
    { "id": "q-3", "questionText": "How do metaclasses work?" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Calls `analyze_question_difficulty`
```json
Request: { "categoryId": "cat-python" }
Response: {
  "analysis": [
    {
      "questionId": "q-1",
      "questionText": "What is a variable in Python?",
      "suggestedDifficulty": "easy",
      "reasoning": "Basic concept, fundamental knowledge",
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "questionId": "q-2",
      "questionText": "Explain Python decorators",
      "suggestedDifficulty": "intermediate",
      "reasoning": "Requires understanding of functions and closures",
      "confidence": 0.88
    },
    {
      "questionId": "q-3",
      "questionText": "How do metaclasses work?",
      "suggestedDifficulty": "hard",
      "reasoning": "Advanced topic, requires deep Python knowledge",
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "easy": 15,
    "intermediate": 20,
    "hard": 7
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Agent reviews and summarizes findings

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Analyzed 42 Python questions:\n\nDifficulty Breakdown:\n- Easy (15 questions): Basic syntax, variables, data types, simple loops\n- Intermediate (20 questions): Functions, OOP, list comprehensions, error handling\n- Hard (7 questions): Decorators, metaclasses, async programming, memory management\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Good balance of easy and intermediate questions\n2. Consider adding more hard-level questions for senior positions\n3. Most confident classifications (>0.9 confidence): 35 questions\n4. Review these manually (lower confidence): q-15, q-23, q-31\n\nSuggested Next Steps:\n- Create 5-10 more advanced Python questions\n- Consider adding expert-level category for metaclasses/async topics"
}
```

## Example 5: Complex Multi-Step Task

### User Request
```http
POST /api/agent/queue
{
  "task": "Review all my questions: categorize any uncategorized ones, find and remove duplicates, and create a summary report"
}
```

### Agent Execution Flow

**Phase 1: Categorization**
1. Calls `get_uncategorized_questions`
2. Calls `get_categories`
3. Uses `batch_update_questions` for efficient categorization

**Phase 2: Duplicate Detection**
4. Calls `find_duplicate_questions`
5. Reviews each duplicate group
6. Calls `delete_question` for redundant ones

**Phase 3: Summary Report**
7. Calls `get_questions` with limit to get total count
8. Calls `get_categories` to count by category
9. Compiles comprehensive report

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Question Database Review Complete\n\nCategorization:\n- Found 12 uncategorized questions\n- Successfully categorized all 12\n  - JavaScript: 5\n  - Python: 4\n  - General: 3\n\nDuplicate Removal:\n- Identified 3 duplicate groups\n- Deleted 3 redundant questions\n- Kept better-worded versions\n\nCurrent Database Summary:\n- Total Questions: 147\n- Categories:\n  - JavaScript: 58\n  - Python: 42\n  - TypeScript: 25\n  - General Programming: 18\n  - Database: 4\n- All questions now properly categorized\n- No duplicates detected\n\nRecommendations:\n- Database looks healthy\n- Consider adding more Database category questions\n- Good distribution across other categories"
}
```

## Example 6: Error Recovery

### User Request (Intentional Error)
```http
POST /api/agent/queue
{
  "task": "Delete all questions in category cat-999"
}
```

### Agent Execution Flow

**Step 1:** Calls `search_questions`
```json
Request: { "searchText": "cat-999" }
Response: { "count": 0, "questions": [] }
```

**Step 2:** Calls `get_categories` to verify category exists
```json
Request: {}
Response: {
  "categories": [
    { "id": "cat-js", "name": "JavaScript" },
    { "id": "cat-py", "name": "Python" }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3:** Agent realizes category doesn't exist

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Unable to complete task: Category 'cat-999' does not exist.\n\nAvailable categories:\n- cat-js: JavaScript\n- cat-py: Python\n\nPlease verify the category ID and try again."
}
```

**Key Point:** Agent handles errors gracefully and provides helpful feedback

## Common Task Patterns

### Pattern 1: Find → Analyze → Act
```
Example: "Find outdated questions and update them"
1. search_questions (find candidates)
2. Agent analyzes each
3. update_question (update as needed)
```

### Pattern 2: Bulk Operations
```
Example: "Categorize 50 questions"
1. get_uncategorized_questions
2. get_categories
3. batch_update_questions (efficient bulk update)
```

### Pattern 3: Data Cleanup
```
Example: "Clean up my question database"
1. find_duplicate_questions
2. delete_question (remove duplicates)
3. get_uncategorized_questions
4. update_question_category (categorize)
```

### Pattern 4: Report Generation
```
Example: "Analyze my question database"
1. get_questions
2. analyze_question_difficulty
3. get_categories
4. Compile comprehensive report
```

## Best Practices for Task Descriptions

### ✅ Good Task Descriptions

**Specific and Clear:**
```
"Categorize all uncategorized JavaScript questions into the JavaScript category"
"Find questions with similarity > 80% and delete the less clear ones"
"Create 10 intermediate TypeScript questions about generics for Senior Frontend position"
```

**Includes Context:**
```
"Review Python questions and suggest which are too easy for Senior Developer role"
"Find duplicate questions, keeping the version with better grammar"
"Create challenging algorithm questions suitable for technical interviews"
```

### ❌ Poor Task Descriptions

**Too Vague:**
```
"Fix the questions"  ← Fix what? How?
"Clean up database"  ← Clean what specifically?
"Make some questions"  ← How many? What topic? What difficulty?
```

**Ambiguous:**
```
"Delete duplicates"  ← Which one to keep? Based on what criteria?
"Update questions"  ← Which questions? Update what fields?
```

## Task Execution Times

Typical execution times for common tasks:

| Task Type | Example | Typical Time |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Simple Retrieval | "List all categories" | 2-5 seconds |
| Single Update | "Update question q-123" | 3-8 seconds |
| Categorization (10 items) | "Categorize 10 questions" | 15-30 seconds |
| Duplicate Detection | "Find duplicates in 100 questions" | 20-40 seconds |
| Batch Creation | "Create 5 new questions" | 25-45 seconds |
| Complex Multi-Step | "Review and clean database" | 45-90 seconds |

**Note:** Times vary based on:
- Number of tool calls required
- Complexity of analysis
- Firestore query performance
- Claude API response time

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Task Progress

```csharp
var task = await _taskQueueService.GetTaskWithUserIdAsync(taskId, userId);

Console.WriteLine($"Status: {task.Status}");
// "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed"

if (task.Status == "completed")
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {task.Result}");
}
else if (task.Status == "failed")
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {task.Error}");
}
```

### View Execution Logs

Check application logs for agent execution details:
```
[AgentExecutor] Starting agent task task-123
[AgentExecutor] Agent iteration 1/20
[AgentExecutor] Executing tool: get_uncategorized_questions
[AgentExecutor] Tool executed successfully
[AgentExecutor] Agent iteration 2/20
[AgentExecutor] Executing tool: update_question_category
...
[AgentExecutor] Agent task completed after 5 iterations
```
